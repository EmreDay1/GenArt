This program simulates the behavior of an incompressible 2D fluid using a grid-based approach. It models how fluid flows by updating velocity and density fields over time, applying three main physical processes: advection to transport quantities along the flow, diffusion to simulate the spreading of fluid and dye, and projection to enforce incompressibility by removing divergence from the velocity field. Each frame, user interaction (mouse drag and click) adds velocity and dye into the system, which are then evolved using numerical solvers to produce visually realistic swirling fluid motion.
